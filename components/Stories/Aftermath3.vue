          That night I left Tuchyn with my sister Basia. My mother Rivka and my
          brothers David and Liova were killed in the ghetto. Out of all of our
          family, including uncles and aunts and their families, only we
          remained, my sister Basia and I.

            During the war, Mania lost most of her family, as her brother Leib
            died serving in the Russian army. Mania fled from the ghetto
            together with her little sister, Basia. Their Polish nanny Zosia hid
            them at first. Then, she moved the sisters to their neighbors, who
            hid them in the basement. Later, Mania and Basia left Tuchyn with
            falsified papers. Mania took the name of a Polish friend Maria and
            passed the war with her sister hidden by and working for a Czech
            family.

            After the war, Maria (formerly Mania) met her future husband
            Alexander Kouts. Alexander was from a neighboring village of Berezne
            and led a group of Russian partisans who fought against the German
            forces. They decided not to stay in the Soviet Union but go to
            Poland. First, they went to Lodz, where Alexander had high
            government responsibilities. They got married in 1945 and in 1948
            their son Eugeniusz was born.

            In 1950, Maria and Alex moved to the Polish capital Warsaw, which
            was ruined during the war. After the war people began rebuilding the
            city and it felt like a “revival” for Maria. She loved city life.

            took the name Gideon. Basia had two sons, Ronny and David. Ronny was

            War. Miriam passed away in 2008. Hear her son Gideon speak about his
