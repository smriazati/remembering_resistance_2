            Yosef Zilberberg was born in Tuchyn in 1933. He lived with his
            parents Yaakov and Asia and his two older brothers, Itkhak and
            Aharon. Yosef loved to paint, and he produced many paintings of his
            family and Tuchyn when he was older.

            Yosef and his family lived on a main road that had gardens and fruit
            trees all around them in private gardens. His mother grew gorgeous
            fresh vegetables for them to eat. She also sold them at their
            familyâ€™s general store.

            Yosef had many relatives in Tuchyn. Every night people from his
            extended family came over to their house to drink tea and tell
            stories. Yosef also lived near his cousin Avraham Elbert, who was a
            few years older.

            Yosef had good memories of Tuchyn, and his family lived alongside
            their Ukrainian neighbors and did business with them. But, this area
            was often a hard place for Jews to live.

            In 1939, when Yosef was six, war broke out. The Russians took over
            Tuchyn and it became hard for his family to sell goods from the
            store. His mother grew vegetables and his father sold milk and
            cheese from two cows.

            In the summer of 1941, the Germans invaded the Soviet Union and
            drove the Russians out of the town. In this exhibition, you will
            learn what happened under the Germans by hearing more about the
            Zilberbergs and other Jewish families in Tuchyn.
