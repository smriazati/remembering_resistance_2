            During the war, Yosef Zilberberg and his family survived in hiding.
            Anton Ozertchuk, a Ukrainian, hid them on his property. They lived
            for over a year in miserable conditions, clustered together under a
            barn that held sheep. While Yosef’s immediate family survived the
            war, the majority of his family perished. Many of Yosef’s aunts,
            uncles, and cousins died at the hands of the Germans and Ukrainians.

            The Zilberberg family continued to hide with Anton for a time after
            the liberation of the area by Russian forces.

            The family feared the unstable Soviet regime, but eventually left
            hiding to move to Rovno. Following the end of the war in 1945, Yosef
            and the Zilberberg family moved to Lodz and later they went to
            Austria. They eventually took part in the “Bricha,” which meant
            Escape, in which Jews illegally made aliyah, or emigrated, to Israel
            (then Palestine). They spent two years living in a tent camp there
            because of the poor economic conditions.

          Currently Yosef resides in Israel where he pursued painting. While
          there are no photographs of the Tuchyn massacres, he has illustrated
          what happened. Anton Ozertchuk and his family were honored as
          Righteous Among the Nations for saving the lives of the Zilberberg
          family. Yosef himself later thanked the Ozertchuks by sending
          financial support and visiting them.
