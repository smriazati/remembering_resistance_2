            Luba Chomut and her parents survived the mass executions in Tuchyn.
            They lived because a Ukrainian farmer Pavlo Gerasimchik hid them in
            his barn for eighteen months. Pavlo made a hole in one of his
            haystacks, bringing them bread and water.

            Luba’s older sister, Chana, was murdered by Ukrainians at age
            eleven. Itzak and Perla had sent Chana to live with the Ukrainian
            principal so she might pass as Christian and survive. The
            principal’s wife forced Chana out when German officials gave the
            order to kill Christian families that hid Jewish children.

            Luba and her parents did not find out about Chana’s death until
            after liberation.

            After the Russians liberated Tuchyn, Luba’s family spent three years
            in a displaced persons camp in Linz, Austria. There, the Chomut
            family changed their name to Emmett and Luba took the name Laura.
            Her parents went by Pearl and Isaak and they had a son Michael in
            the camp. The family originally hoped to settle in Israel (then
            Palestine) but they ultimately emigrated to the United States in
            1949. Hear Laura speak about her family’s migration to the United
            States.

          Pavlo Gerasimchik, his wife Lubka, and their children were honored as
          The Righteous Among the Nations for their actions. This award honors
          people who risked their own lives to save Jewish people during the
          Holocaust. Authors published two books about Laura’s experiences:
          Brisko and The Girl in the Haystack. These works teach about her
          family’s survival in the face of hatred and antisemitism. Today, Laura
          Emmett Oberlender lives in Florida and New Jersey. She is a mother of
          three and grandmother of six.
