          <h2>What was the Judenrat?</h2>
          <p>
            The Zaltsman House served as the headquarters of the Judenrat
            (Jewish council) in Tuchyn. German officials established the
            Judenrat to control Jewish communities. Often, members of the
            Judenrat were elected by the local Jewish populations they were to
            serve. But all selections had to be approved by the German command,
            and so council members were essentially appointed to their
            positions. The candidates were typically influential people in the
            Jewish community.

          Getzel Shwartzsman, Mania Schwartzman’s father, was a “soltis” a
          respected Jewish elder in Tuchyn. The Germans appointed him to lead
          the Judenrat and he felt a great responsibility to look after his
          fellow Jews.

          The Nazis expected Schwartzman and his deputy Meir Himelfarb to help
          with their cruel and violent orders. For instance, German officials
          forced Jews to wear cloth armbands and patches to identify themselves.
          Early versions of this featured a blue Star of David on a white cloth.
          Eventually, this changed to a yellow star. The intention of these
          armbands was to isolate, harass, and humiliate Jewish people, further
          embedding the Nazi ideology that Jewish people were different and
          inferior to the rest of the population.

            These individuals felt a great responsibility to look after their
            fellow Jews, but also were expeceted to carry out the orders of the
            Nazi regime, which amounted to policies that were increasingly
            determential to Jewish life.

            One example is the manufacturing of cloth armbands Jews were forced
            to wear to identify themselves. Early versions of this featured a
            blue Star of David on a white cloth. Eventually this changed to a
            black band with a yellow Star of David. The intention of these
            armbands was to isolate, harass, and humiliate Jewish people,
            further embedding the Nazi ideology that Jewish people were
            different from the rest of the population.
