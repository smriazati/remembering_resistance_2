          This store in Tuchyn was once a synagogue, a Jewish place of worship.
          Synagogues are the center of prayer, study, and Jewish social life.
          Within the synagogue, there is a place called a sanctuary where clergy
          perform prayer services and that houses the Torah scrolls, Jewish
          sacred texts. Tuchyn had a number of synagogues with different
          traditions and among them stood the Great Synagogue. The Jewish
          residents regarded the Great Synagogue as ancient and spoke of it with
          great reverence.

          Synagogues were the center of Jewish life. So when the Germans invaded
          Tuchyn in July 1941, they knew to target the city’s synagogues. Three
          days after the Germans arrived, they entered a synagogue on Shabbat.
          They opened the Holy Ark, a chest that houses the Torah scrolls. The
          Germans then forced Jewish residents to burn the Torahs. It is a
          desecration to burn the Torah, and Jews are also forbidden to make
          fires on Shabbat.

          Germans further disrespected local Jews by using their synagogue as
          grain storehouses. The Germans tried to destroy Jewish culture and
          religion as part of their mass extermination. Today, no synagogues
          remain in Tuchyn.
