          Luba Chomut lived as a child with her family in a beautiful new home.
          When the German army arrived in Tuchyn in July 1941, they appointed
          many Ukrainians to high-ranking positions. With newfound power, a
          group of Ukrainian police organized a pogrom, a violent riot in which
          gangs robbed, beat, and killed Jewish people.

          Some local Ukrainians had noticed the Chomut house and pounded on the
          door where Luba lived. They threw Luba’s mother Perla into the
          courtyard and beat her with studded wooden planks until they thought
          she was dead.

              A pogrom organized by a group of Ukrainian policemen under the
              auspices of German forces. Before World War II, pogroms occurred
              in Eastern Europe for centuries. By Yosef Zilberberg, Courtesy

            These Ukrainians entered the house and beat Luba until she fell
            unconscious. Her father Itzak discovered that they had crushed
            Perla’s bones and she had gaping holes in her head. Luba was beaten
            so badly that she remained paralyzed for a time.

            The next day one of Tuchyn’s few doctors, Homeniuk, collaborated
            with the Ukrainian police and refused to give medical care to the
            injured. Luba’s father was determined, however, and found a willing
            doctor named Bortenovski who helped despite facing threats. Perla
            and Luba lived, but they suffered severe injuries.
