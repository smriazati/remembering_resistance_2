              assisted in the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Wehrmacht
              worked closely with Gestapo forces to enforce antisemitic polices
              and commit war crimes. Courtesy Yad Vashem.

          The German military maintained an outpost known as the gendarmerie in
          Tuchyn, a site of violence and abuse. When the German military
          arrived, they created an auxiliary police force. They also brought
          with them their antisemitic policies and exacerbated local anti-Jewish
          sentiments.

          One Jewish youth, Ze’ev Portnoy, experienced the cruelties of the
          gendarmerie when German officers captured him. They drove him to the
          gendarmerie with his hands and feet bound. Ze’ev was locked in a cell
          with signs of torture and murder. After a few days, officers ordered
          Ze’ev to chop wood and dig his own grave. Instead, Ze’ev ran and
          escaped to another village.

              person.) The German military posted anti-Jewish placards like this
              everywhere and ordered local Ukrainians not to give asylum to
              Jewish residents. Courtesy YIVO Institute for Jewish Research.

          This antisemitic violence went hand in hand with systemic
          discrimination. The Gestapo commander placed a tax on Jews and
          collected their valuable possessions. Jews were also forced to labor
          to produce goods for Germany. They worked without pay under terrible
          conditions. Despite the economic profits of Jewish forced labor,
          German officials eventually ordered the establishment of the Tuchyn
          ghetto to exterminate all remaining Jewish residents.

        <h2>What is antisemitism?</h2>
        <p>
          Antisemitism is prejudice against or hatred of Jewish people.
          According to Nazi ideology, Jews constituted a separate and dangerous
          race that could never assimilate into European society. This racist
          ideology was widespread throughout Europe. People often feared and
          scapegoated Jewish people for their religious beliefs and their
          so-called “racial characteristics.” Governments blamed Jews for their
          country’s economic shortcomings. Many Ukrainians condemned local Jews
          for the region’s hardship under Soviet occupation. It did not matter
          what European Jewry did —antisemites did not view them as equal or as
          human beings.
