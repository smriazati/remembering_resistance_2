> They tried to bury us, they didn’t know we were seeds.
Dinos Christianopoulos

In 2011, Zeev Portnoy, Yosef Zilberberg, and Miriam Schwartzman Koutz’s son Gideon erected a monument on the site of the Tuchyn ghetto in honor of the uprising and the lives lost. 

The places  where people died lie unmarked today, No traces remain of the massacres that happened there.   

With this exhibit, we remember what happened. 

As you leave the digital exhibit, consider these questions. How are people are treated as less-than in your community today? How can we as a community prevent intolerance and violence in all of its forms?
