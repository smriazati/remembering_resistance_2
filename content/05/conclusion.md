> They tried to bury us, they didn’t know we were seeds.
Dinos Christianopoulos, Greek poet

In 2011, Yosef Zilberberg, Ze’ev Portnoy, Miriam Schwartzman Kouts’ son Gideon, and others returned to Tuchyn. They erected a monument on the site of the ghetto that honored the uprising and the lives lost. 

Most forests, cemeteries, and fields where people died in Tuchyn and throughout Ukraine lie unmarked today. Few traces remain of the massacres that happened there.   

With this exhibit, we resist this silence and root ourselves in remembering.

Consider how people are treated in your lives. What seeds of resistance do you take from Tuchyn? Where can you plant them?
