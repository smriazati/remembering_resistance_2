# Synagogue

This store in Tuchyn was once a synagogue, a Jewish place of worship. Synagogues are the center of prayer, study, and Jewish social life. Within the synagogue, there is a place called a sanctuary where clergy perform prayer services and that houses the Torah scrolls, Jewish sacred texts. Tuchyn had a number of synagogues with different traditions and among them stood the Great Synagogue. The Jewish residents regarded the Great Synagogue as ancient and spoke of it with great reverence.

> On Sabbath eve [the Jewish day of rest], fathers and sons dressed in their Sabbath clothes, started to stream for prayers… And how beautiful was the sight of the burning Sabbath candles and the tables covered with white tablecloth that were seen from each house. 
--Zushia Rotelman, Former Resident of Tuchyn

Synagogues were the center of Jewish life. So when the Germans invaded Tuchyn in July 1941, they knew to target the city’s synagogues. Three days after the Germans arrived, they entered a synagogue on Shabbat. They opened the Holy Ark, a chest that houses the Torah scrolls. The Germans then forced Jewish residents to burn the Torahs. It is a desecration to burn the Torah, and Jews are also forbidden to make fires on Shabbat.
 
Germans further disrespected local Jews by using their synagogue as grain storehouses. The Germans tried to destroy Jewish culture and religion as part of their mass extermination. Today, no synagogues remain in Tuchyn.
