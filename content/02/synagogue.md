# Synagogue

In July of 1941, When the Germans entered Tuchyn, the Ukrainians almost instantly began to treat Jewish people unjustly even more so than they did under Soviet occupation. The presence of the Nazis in Tuchyn empowered the Ukrainians to treat Jewish people horribly. Ukrainians began looting Jewish homes and attacking Jewish people.

Roughly three days after their arrival the Nazis entered the Synagogue on Shabbat and opened the Holy Ark and removed the Torahs. The Nazis then forced the Jews to burn their own sacred text on the Sabbath. It is a desecration to burn the Torah and Jews are also prohibited from making fires on the Sabbath. Nazis further disrespected the Jews by using their synagogue as grain storehouses.
