# The Chomut House

Luba Chomut lived as a child with her family in a beautiful new home. When the German army arrived in Tuchyn in July 1941, they appointed many Ukrainians to high-ranking positions. With newfound power, a group of Ukrainian police organized a pogrom, a violent riot in which gangs robbed, beat, and killed Jewish people.  

Some local Ukrainians had noticed the Chomut house and pounded on the door where Luba lived. They threw Luba’s mother Perla into the courtyard and beat her with studded wooden planks until they thought she was dead.

> I remember my sister and I were standing in the doorway; we were screaming. [My mother’s] blood was gushing out of her head….
–Luba Chomut

These Ukrainians entered the house and beat Luba until she fell unconscious. Her father Itzak discovered that they had crushed Perla’s bones and she had gaping holes in her head. Luba was beaten so badly that she remained paralyzed for a time.

The next day one of Tuchyn’s few doctors, Homeniuk, collaborated with the Ukrainian police and refused to give medical care to the injured. Luba’s father was determined, however, and found a willing doctor named Bortenovski who helped despite facing threats. Perla and Luba lived, but they suffered severe injuries. 

> Outside, I saw the destruction from the night of terrors. In the street, the bodies of the murdered were still lying. From inside the houses came the fractured cries of the severely wounded.
–Itzak Chomut, Luba’s Father
