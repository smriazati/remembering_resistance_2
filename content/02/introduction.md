# The Take-Over of Tuchyn 1941-1942

> It was precious to us, we were born there, studied, and spent our childhood days there. Only yesterday you belonged to an extensive family of father and mother, brothers and sisters, relatives and friends, but now you are alone like a sheep in a field without a shepherd. Sometimes you stand and ask yourself: Is it true? Did all of this happen in the progressive world of the twentieth century?

--Yitzchak Gilberg, a Jewish resident of Tuchyn

This map will be different from other maps you have seen before. It is a map that goes back in time to 1941 when the Germanâ€™s defeated the Soviets and took over the town of Tuchyn, Ukraine. Tuchyn was a small town but it was home to many Jews, a few you have already met.  In Tuchyn, Jewish residents went to school and work. They loved, married, and formed friendships. 

After the war, Tuchyn no longer existed for the Jews. It was destroyed and almost all its Jewish residents were killed by Nazis and Ukrainian helpers.  

This map attempts to answer these two questions: 


1. How did the Nazi regime take control of Tuchyn? 
2. How did the residents of Tuchyn respond?

You may click on any or all locations on the map. As you go through the map we ask that you think of places in your own childhoods. The places you have played and laughed in. The places you have cried in or felt unsafe in. We ask as you learn about these places in Tuchyn that you remember it was home for the Jews and filled with just as many memories as your places.
