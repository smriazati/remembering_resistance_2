# The Takeover of Tuchyn 1941-1942

## A StoryMap

This map takes you back in time to 1941 when German forces took over the town of Tuchyn in what is now Ukraine. Tuchyn was a small shtetl, a town home to many Jews, some of whom you have already met. 

This map takes you to several sites where Tuchyn’s Jewish residents experienced discrimination and violence under German occupation. After the war, Tuchyn no longer existed for the Jewish population as Germans and Ukrainian forces killed almost all its Jewish residents.

Click on the map’s locations and learn about this history. Think of places in your own childhood where you played, laughed, or cried. Remember that it was home for the Jewish community and filled with just as many memories as your places. 

> It was precious to us, we were born there, studied, and spent our childhood days there… Sometimes you stand and ask yourself: Is it true? Did all of this happen in the progressive world of the twentieth century?
--Yitzchak Gilberg, a Jewish resident of Tuchyn
