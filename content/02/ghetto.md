# The Ghetto

> They (the Germans) said by a certain date, everyone had to be inside the ghetto, otherwise, you’ll be killed. And we knew this was the end, because we heard about other towns, and so–we knew it was the end.
-Laura Oberlender in an interview with Cookie Schwartz, February 20, 1996. 


## Ghettos and the “Final Solution”

To advance their plan to murder the Jews of Europe, the Nazi authorities orderd the concentration of Jews into segrageted spaces refered to as ghettos. Elements of ordinary life such as education, cultural activities, medical services, and the practice of religion were abolished in these spaces, as the Germans ordered Jews to surrender their homes and belongings, and forced them to supply labor to the war effort. Eventually, the ghettos were abandoned, as Jews were deported in massive numbers to the concentration camps.



## The Tuchyn Ghetto

The ghetto in Tuchyn was somewhat unique, as it came later than those built in the surrounding area, and was referred to initially as an “open ghetto”--meaning people could come and go somewhat easily. Getzel Shvartsman and the rest of the Judenrat, with the aid of bribes, were able to stall the establishment of a formal, enclosed ghetto until early September 1942. The ghetto was made up of about 50 small homes, and was very crowded, as many Jews had migrated into the town from nearby villages.
