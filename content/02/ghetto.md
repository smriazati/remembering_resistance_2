# The Ghetto

This site marks a boundary of the Tuchyn ghetto, a part of town where German officials forced the Jewish community to live. The ghetto was made up of about 50 small homes and was very crowded, as many Jews had come there from nearby villages. During the Holocaust, the Germans created thousands of ghettos across Eastern Europe.

The ghetto in Tuchyn was an “open ghetto,” meaning people could come and go somewhat easily. Getzel Shwartzman and the Judenrat, with the aid of bribes, stalled the establishment of a formal, enclosed ghetto until early September 1942. 

> [German officials] said by a certain date, everyone had to be inside the ghetto, otherwise, you’ll be killed. And we knew this was the end, because we heard about other towns, and so–we knew it was the end.

The German administration also abolished elements of Jewish life such as Jewish schools, cultural activities, medical services, and religious practice. They ordered Jews to surrender their homes and belongings and forced them to supply labor to the war effort. Eventually, ghettos were eliminated, as Jewish people were murdered outright in their own communities or deported to concentration and extermination camps.
