## What was the Judenrat? 

The Judenrat, or Jewish council, was a “self-governing” intermediary established by Nazi leadership to control Jewish communities. Members of the Judenrat were elected by the local populations they were to serve, but all selections had to be approved by the German command, resulting in the council members being essentially appointed to their positions. The candidates were typically influential people in the Jewish community, with many serving as rabbis. These individuals felt a great responsibility to look after their fellow Jews, but also were expeceted to carry out the orders of the Nazi regime, which amounted to policies that were increasingly determential to Jewish life. 

One example is the manufacturing of cloth armbands Jews were forced to wear to identify themselves. Early versions of this featured a blue Star of David on a white cloth. Eventually this changed to a black band with a yellow Star of David. The intention of these armbands was to isolate, harass, and humiliate Jewish people, further embedding  the Nazi ideology that Jewish people were different from the rest of the population.
