# Gendarmerie

The German military maintained an outpost known as the gendarmerie in Tuchyn, a site of violence and abuse. When the German military arrived, they created an auxiliary police force. They also brought with them their antisemitic policies and exacerbated local anti-Jewish sentiments. 

One Jewish youth, Ze’ev Portnoy, experienced the cruelties of the gendarmerie when German officers captured him. They drove him to the gendarmerie with his hands and feet bound. Ze’ev was locked in a cell with signs of torture and murder. After a few days, officers ordered Ze’ev to chop wood and dig his own grave. Instead, Ze’ev ran and escaped to another village. 

> They… locked me in a small room that had a window with bars on it. There were abandoned clothes and objects there, apparently of Jews who had been ‘taken care of’ there.
– Ze’ev Portnoy

This antisemitic violence went hand in hand with systemic discrimination. The Gestapo commander placed a tax on Jews and collected their valuable possessions. Jews were also forced to labor to produce goods for Germany. They worked without pay under terrible conditions. Despite the economic profits of Jewish forced labor, German officials eventually ordered the establishment of the Tuchyn ghetto to exterminate all remaining Jewish residents.

## What is antisemitism?

Antisemitism is prejudice against or hatred of Jewish people. According to Nazi ideology, Jews constituted a separate and dangerous race that could never assimilate into European society. This racist ideology was widespread throughout Europe. People often feared and scapegoated Jewish people for their religious beliefs and their so-called “racial characteristics.” Governments blamed Jews for their country’s economic shortcomings. Many Ukrainians condemned local Jews for the region’s hardship under Soviet occupation. It did not matter what European Jewry did —antisemites did not view them as equal or as human beings.
