# German HQ

> The German soldiers set themselves up in Tuchyn. In the first days, they took over all the offices: city hall, the post office, the schools.
-Miriam Shvartzman-Kotz, Tuchyn (1967)

The Germans arrived in Tuchyn in the summer of 1941. There were mixed reactions from residents of Tuchyn. Many Ukrainians were thrilled at German arrival because life under Soviet Communism was difficult. Rumors had spread that Germany would make Ukraine an independent country and give Ukrainian citizens the control to plunder Jews’ goods without restriction. 

> They called outcries of welcome to the Germans and shouted, ‘Death to the Jews.’
--Shalom Cholevski, a Jewish resident in 1941 

Many of the Jews were terrified and attempted to flee into Russia. Some believed rumors from Polish Jews refugees that German control was not that bad. When the Germans came marching through the city, the Jews hid in their houses. Some built hiding shelters in their homes.  

At first, the Germans left the Jews alone but they gave Ukrainians the authority to do as they wished to Jews residents. When the Germans began establishing more control, they began stealing valuables from Jews and forcing them to work. For many Jews, having a work card meant you could live. 

> Of course, no one had any idea of what was ahead. And despite this, my father enlarged the basement, built a wall of boards, and concealed it with firewood and straw. The place was intended to be a hiding place in difficult times.
-- Zeev Portnoy, a young Jewish resident in 1941
