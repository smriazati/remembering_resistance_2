# Horyn River

In this case, you might get around it in that section (when you discuss the outbreak of war against the Soviet Union in summer 1941) by saying that Nazis viewed Jews and Communists as two of their main enemies; and because they viewed the Soviet Union as the main bastion and exporter of communism and as the homeland to many Jews, the war in the East was ideological in a way that it was not in the West (against France and Britain, e.g.). And this ideological aspect made the violence especially brutal on the Eastern front.

The Horyn River is where the German troops entered the town of Tuchyn in July 1941. Germany invaded the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941, and so invaded the region where Tuchyn sat. Violence was especially brutal on this Eastern Front because Nazis viewed Jews and communists as their main enemies. So, for the Jewish population of Tuchyn, the German invasion of the communist Soviet Union meant a series of extremely harsh, violent, and antisemitic policies.
 
> Of course no one had any idea of what was ahead [when the Germans came]. And despite this, my father enlarged the basement, built a wall of boards, and concealed it with firewood and straw. The place was intended to be a hiding place in difficult times.

The Germans sought the destruction of the Soviet Union. But, in 1941, Germany’s Chancellor Adolf Hitler shifted policy from the extreme persecution of Jews to a policy of mass murder. Hitler and the Nazi Party began planning the extermination of all Eastern European Jews.
 
When the Germans arrived, many Jews felt terror and families looked for places to hide. Jewish families left their homes and fled to the edge of the city. The Ukraninans welcomed the Germans with open arms, sometimes even yelling “Death to the Jews.” Luba Chomut recalled that a week after the Germans arrived there was a pogrom in which Ukrainian gangs killed members of the Jewish community and attacked Luba and her mother.
