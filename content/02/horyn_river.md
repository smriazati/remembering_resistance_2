# Horyn River

The Horyn River is where the Nazi armies entered the town of Tuchyn. Before the Nazis arrived, in Tuchyn the Soviets were there. The Soviets entered Tuchyn in September 1939, and they assumed control of the town while leaving some of the town's infrastructure like education alone. Under Soviet occupation, Jewish people were oppressed and experienced unfair treatment. When the Nazis began to advance on Tuchyn the Soviets fled and, in their exodus, they destroyed the bridge that goes over the Horyn River.

When the Nazis arrived, the Ukrainians greeted them with enthusiasm. The bridge was destroyed and the Ukrainians readied boats to help the Nazis enter the town, and upon their arrival, the Jews of Tuchyn were immediately terrified and saw to hide and moved to the edges of the city as far away from Nazi occupation as possible. Under Nazi occupation, the Jews faced far worse persecution and oppression than under the Soviets. The Jews were treated as second-class citizens under Nazi occupation.
