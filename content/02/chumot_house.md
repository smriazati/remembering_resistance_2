# The Chumot House

## What happened when the Germans first arrived?

Everything changed within the first week of German arrival. Immediately, Germans and Ukrainians formed a pogrom. Laura’s family, “the Chumots,” were one of very few Jewish families to survive these massacres. The Chumot family had just moved into a beautiful new home, and it attracted attention. The Germans and Ukrainians pounded on the door until Pearl, Laura’s mother, answered it. Without a word, they threw Pearl into the courtyard and beat her until they thought she was dead.  Laura describes:

 > “I remember my sister and I were standing in the doorway; we were screaming. [My mother’s] blood was gushing out of her head…."

The Germans and Ukrainians entered the house and beat Laura until she fell unconscious. When Laura’s father discovered his family—Pearl’s bones were crushed, and she had several gaping holes in her head. Laura was beaten so badly that she was paralyzed. The next day Germans and Ukrainians ordered doctors not to give medical care to those injured. However, Laura’s father was determined and found a willing doctor. Pearl and Laura lived, but they were severely injured. Laura’s father describes the next morning:

> “Outside, I saw the destruction from the night of terrors. In the street, the bodies of the murdered were still lying. From inside the houses came the fractured cries of the severely wounded.”
