# Aftermath: Luba Chomut

Luba Chomut and her parents survived the mass executions in Tuchyn. They lived because a Ukrainian farmer Pavlo Gerasimchik hid them in his barn for eighteen months. Pavlo made a hole in one of his haystacks, bringing them bread and water. 
Luba’s older sister, Chana, was murdered by Ukrainians at age eleven. Itzak and Perla had sent Chana to live with the Ukrainian principal so she might pass as Christian and survive. The principal’s wife forced Chana out when German officials gave the order to kill Christian families that hid Jewish children.

Luba and her parents did not find out about Chana’s death until after liberation. Listen below to hear her speak about her sister’s death.
