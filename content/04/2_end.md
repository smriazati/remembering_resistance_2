The family feared the unstable Soviet regime, but eventually left hiding to move to Rovno. Following the end of the war in 1945, Yosef and the Zilberberg family moved to Lodz and later they went to Austria. They eventually took part in the “Bricha,” which meant Escape, in which Jews illegally made aliyah, or emigrated, to Israel (then Palestine). They spent two years living in a tent camp there because of the poor economic conditions. Listen to hear Yosef talk about his family’s decision to move.

Currently Yosef resides in Israel where he pursued painting. While there are no photographs of the Tuchyn massacres, he has illustrated what happened. Anton Ozertchuk and his family were honored as Righteous Among the Nations for saving the lives of the Zilberberg family. Yosef himself later thanked the Ozertchuks by sending financial support and visiting them.
