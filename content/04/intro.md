It is estimated that nearly 2,000 Jews escaped into the forests surrounding Tuchyn. 

Around half of them had been captured and killed within three days of the ghetto fire. 

Many realized that they could not survive in the forests and attempted to return to Tuchyn in search of food, shelter, and clothing.

Those who returned to the village were shot and killed.

753 Jews were shot in the Jewish cemetery. 

240 Jews were killed by Ukrainian partisans in the Kudrinka forest.

More than 300 Jews, Ukrainians, and Poles were massacred by the German Gendarmerie in the town park. 

Some of those who remained in the forests died of hunger and cold.

By the liberation of Tuchyn on January 16, 1944, around 20 Jews remained in the area.

In total, only 69 Jews survived Tuchyn, escaping to the United States and Israel.
