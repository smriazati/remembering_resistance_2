# Aftermath: Yosef Zilberberg

During the war, Yosef Zilberberg and his family survived in hiding. Anton Ozertchuk, a Ukrainian, hid them on his property. They lived for over a year in miserable conditions, clustered together under a barn that held sheep. While Yosef’s immediate family survived the war, the majority of his family perished. Many of Yosef’s aunts, uncles, and cousins died at the hands of the Germans and Ukrainians. 

The Zilberberg family continued to hide with Anton for a time after the liberation of the area by Russian forces. Hear Yosef recall a poignant memory with Anton.
