Mania Schwartzman was born in Tuchyn in 1924. She had a younger sister Basia and three brothers David, Leib, and Lova. They lived with their parents Getzl and Rivka in a house in the “Zamd” (Sands). 

The Zamd sat in an area of town with beautiful buildings, a garden of fruit trees, and the Horyn River. Mania’s family had a large tree that stood near the house along the path to the river. It still stands there today. 
 
Mania’s father Getzl ran the town’s transportation company and garage. Many people considered him a “soltis,” a village elder and a leader in the Jewish community. He later became the head of the Judenrat, Jewish Council, during the German occupation. 

In 1939, when Mania was fifteen, war broke out and the Russians took over Tuchyn. Two years later in the summer of 1941, the Germans invaded the Soviet Union and drove the Russians out of the area.

In this exhibition, you will learn what happened under the Germans by hearing more about the Schwartzmans and other Jewish families in Tuchyn.
