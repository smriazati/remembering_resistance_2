Far away in Ukraine sits a village named Tuchyn. It is surrounded by farmland and forests. 

During the Holocaust, the Germans took over Tuchyn. In September 1942, the Jews of Tuchyn rose up against the Nazis. They set fire to their homes and fought back. 

Thousands of people fled to the surrounding forests. Many Jews ultimately perished at the hands of the Germans and their Ukrainian neighbors.

Few people know about this uprising. In this exhibit, you will uncover this history yourselves as you hear from people who lived through it.
