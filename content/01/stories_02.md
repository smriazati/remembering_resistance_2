# Meet Yosef Zilberberg

My name is Yosef. I was born in Tuchyn in 1933, the same year that Adolf Hitler and the Nazis came to power in Germany. 

I lived far away from Germany, though. Tuchyn was in Poland and is now in Ukraine. It was a “shtetl,” a small village with a close Jewish community. 

I lived with my family - my two brothers and my parents Asia and Yaakov. 

We lived on a main road that had gardens and fruit trees all around us. My mother grew gorgeous fresh vegetables and we sold them at our grocery store. 

We had many families in Tuchyn and every night people came over to our house and drank tea and told stories. 

I also lived near my cousin Avraham Elbert, who was a few years older than me. We both survived the war and have been very close throughout our lives.  

I have good memories of Tuchyn and we lived alongside our neighbors and did business with them. But, Poland was often a hard place for Jews to live. Things were so bad at times that thousands of people emigrated to other countries. 

In 1939, when I was six, war broke out. Our town of Tuchyn was no longer in Poland. First, the Russians took it over and then the Germans. 

In the next part of the exhibit, you will encounter a storymap that will teach you about what happened when the Germans occupied Tuchyn.
