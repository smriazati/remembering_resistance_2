Meet Miriam Schwartzman I am Miriam and I was born in 1924. I grew up in Tuchyn, a small shtetl (village) in what was then Poland. There were about 700 Jewish families and we were a very close community, with our own schools, synagogues (places of worship), and youth organizations. I had a younger sister Basia and two brothers David and Liova. We lived with my parents Getzl and Rivka in a house in the “Zamed” (Sands). The “Zamed” was an area of town with beautiful buildings, a garden of fruit trees, and a river for boating.  We had a large tree that stood near our house - it was on the path to the river. It is still standing today.        My father was a “soltis,” a village elder and a leader in our Jewish community. He would later become the head of the Judenrat, or Jewish Council, under the Nazis. In 1939, when I was fifteen, war broke out. Our town of Tuchyn was no longer in Poland. First, the Russians took it over and then the Germans. In the next part of the exhibit, you will encounter a storymap that will teach you about what happened when the Germans occupied Tuchyn.
