# Meet Luba Chomut

My name is Luba Chomut. I was born in 1934, a year after Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power in Germany. 

I lived far away from Germany, though. I lived over 1,000 miles away from Berlin in Tuchyn. Tuchyn was a shtetl (village) in what was then Poland.

We lived in a rural area and farmers grew food on farms all around us. Our village had many businesses too, from making fabric to wagons. 

My favorite day of the week was Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest. On that day many people went to synagogue (place of worship) and did not work. On Shabbat, Iâ€™d wear my blue coat and leather boots. I walked around Tuchyn with Chana. We had such a nice time looking at the shops and the schools. 
 
We had a large family with a number of aunts and uncles and cousins. We lived in a new house with my parents Perl and Yitzchak and we saw our other family often.

But, Tuchyn was not the best place for Jews to live. Ukrainians called us names and threw stones at us. Things were so bad at times that thousands of people left and moved to the United States or to Palestine, which later became Israel. 

In 1939, when I was five, war broke out. First, the Russians took over our town. Then, in 1941 the Germans did. 

In the next part of the exhibit, you will encounter a storymap that will teach you about what happened when the Germans occupied Tuchyn.
